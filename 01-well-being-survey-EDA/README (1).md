## Data Preparation
- Collected responses from multiple participants using a structured well-being survey.  
- Cleaned data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistent labels, and standardizing categorical variables.  
- Conducted feature inspection and summary statistics to validate data quality.

---

## Exploratory Analysis
- Examined relationships among **sleep duration, stress level, exercise frequency,** and **overall satisfaction**.  
- Visualized key trends using correlation heatmaps, box plots, and pairwise distributions.  
- Used descriptive statistics and group comparisons to highlight differences across age and gender segments.

## Key Insights
- Respondents sleeping **7–8 hours/night** reported the **highest average well-being scores**.  
- **Stress level** showed a strong negative correlation with **overall satisfaction**.  
- Participants with regular exercise routines scored **20–30% higher in well-being metrics**.
